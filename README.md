The term fractal was first used by mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot in 1974,
he based it on the Latin word fractus, meaning "broken" or "fractured".
A fractal is an abstract mathematical object, like a curve or a surface, which has a similar
pattern whatever the scale.

This project will be the opporunity to hone miniLibX skills, to make
discover/use the mathematical notion of complex numbers and to take a peek at the
concept of optimization in computer graphics

This project’s goal is to create a small fractal exploration program. Start by seeing what
a fractal is.

The constraints are as follows:
• Your software should offer at least 3 different types of fractals, including the Julia
set and the Mandelbrot set. The third fractal (and the optional additional ones)
can be whatever you want.
• It must be possible to make the parameter of the Julia set vary only with the mouse
(without clicking). For the other types of fractal, the decision is yours.
• The mouse wheel zooms in and out, almost infinitely (within the limits of the
computer). This is the very principle of fractals.
• You must use at least a few colors to show the depth of each fractal. It’s even better
if you hack away on psychedelic effects.
• A parameter is passed on the command line to define what type of fractal will be
viewed. If no parameter is provided, or if the parameter is invalid, the program
displays a list of available parameters and exits properly

As for the graphic representation:
• ESC will exit the program.
• The use of images of the minilibX is strongly.
